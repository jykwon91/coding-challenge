# Interview Challenge Validator


This validator will help you verify that the output generated by your challenge has the correct shape to help smooth out your interview process.

---
## How to use
You may run this locally if you have Python installed on your system. On most systems it should already be installed by default.
- first set OUTPUT_PATH to the parent path containing your 'output.json' and 'Output' directory
	```py
	OUTPUT_PATH = './path/to/output'
	```
- save the file and run it
	```sh
	python amc_interview_validator.py
	```
<br />
Alternatively you can run this in any online Python REPL, such as [this one](https://www.online-python.com/online_python_compiler) like so:

- copy and paste the code into the editor
- declare the json object you wish to validate as VALIDATION_ENTRY
- for example:
	```py
	VALIDATION_ENTRY = {
		"test.email@domain.com": 90,
		"other.email@domain.net": 180,
	}
	```
